# JADE ATCG Schema
This repository contains JADE's Automated Test Code Generator. It enables you to record and replay GUI actions in JADE applications, by capturing the execution of GUI event methods and generating code to replay those actions.
ATCG should not be loaded directly under RootSchema, rather as a subschema of a schema that is to be tested.

## Documentation Guide
Documentation for the ATCG schema may be found here: <a href="">ATCG Documentation</a>

## Getting Started
These instructions will get a copy of ATCG up and running on your local machine.
