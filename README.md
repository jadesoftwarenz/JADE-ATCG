# JADE ATCG Schema
This repository contains JADE's Automated Test Code Generator. It enables you to record and replay GUI actions in JADE applications, by capturing the execution of GUI event methods and generating code to replay those actions.
ATCG should not be loaded directly under RootSchema, rather as a subschema of a schema that is to be tested.

## Documentation Guide
Documentation for the ATCG schema may be found here: <a href="">ATCG Documentation</a>

## Getting Started
These instructions will get a copy of ATCG up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you can load the schemas, you will need JADE 2018 installed:

1. Grab a FREE Developer's license at https://secure.jadeworld.com/devlicense/
2. Download the JADE 2018 release at https://www.jadeworld.com/solutions-for/dev-partners/ 
3. Open the installer and follow the instructions in the easy install wizard.
4. JADE is now installed, and a shortcut has been placed in your Start menu. You're good to go!

### Choose the application to be tested with ATCG

You will need a schema with a GUI application to make use of ATCG's GUI replaying capability. If you don't have such a schema and you merely wish to see how ATCG works, you may find a suitable demonstration schema at <a href="https://github.com/jadesoftwarenz/Erewhon">Erewhon Repository</a>
